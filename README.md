# Telecom_Churn_Prediction

The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust churn prediction model that could accurately identify potential churners within the telecom customer base. By proactively identifying customers at risk of churning, the telecom company can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers and improved customer service, to reduce churn rates and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
